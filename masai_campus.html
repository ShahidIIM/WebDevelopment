    <h2>Masai School Campus</h2>
    <p>Our main campus is centrally located in Kormangala, Heart of Bangalore which is well connected to every part of the city.<br> Our Patna campus is located at Kankarbagh Main Road. The reason for choosing co-working space over any other <br>classroom is very simple - there is no better place to learn coding than being in the environment of 50+ tech teams of<br> various companies.</p>
